# screenToString
Small experiment with pytesseract lib.

This code is not usable outside of a IDE right now.
Its just a small experiment to get into OCR (Optical Character Ecognition).
This Code wont work unless you have the pytesseract library installed and know how to use it.

Once everything is installed and ready:
1. Start the code.
2. Enter the relative path to the screenshot you want to convert into string.
3. Enjoy.
